    <string name="lifecycle_explanation">The best way to understand what is happening here is opening logcat and
        filtering for "lifecyle counter".\n\nEach field is updated in a slightly different way. The first is always
        updated (could create problems while the app is in the background). The second is only updated while the
        activity is started and the third while the activity is resumed.\n\nIn order to see the differences between
    them, you can open logcat with the filter and then try opening a dialog (activity pauses) or leave the app
    (activity stops).\n\nAdditionally, if you press back, you destroy the acticity and all updates stop.</string>
