<p>Observe the current state of this MVFlow object. When you subscribe, you also get the current value as the first
emission.</p>
<p>This is just a utility method that <em>you probably don't need</em>. Be mindful what you do with it. While this might
make some functionality easier to implement, you are risking breaking the MVI concept and its advantages!</p>
<p>Note: this uses a <a href="https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.channels/-channel/-factory/-c-o-n-f-l-a-t-e-d.html">kotlinx.coroutines.channels.Channel.Factory.CONFLATED</a> channel so the states you see might
differ from the events the MVFlow object sees. If your observer or the view take too long collecting one value
and two or more values are emitted during that time, only the latest one would be emitted to the slow collector
(while the fast collecter could receive all of the values). In normal situations the collection should be very
quick and skipping states should not matter due to immutability.</p>
